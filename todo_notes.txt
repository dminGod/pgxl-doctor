The list of common problems that generally occur:

- Different nodes in the cluster view each other differently - Some may refer to themselves or others with localhost 
and default ports rather than correct references.

- Configuration of the max pool size and max connections between the coordiantor and the datanode is wrong -- this leads 
to 'connection pool issues'

- What servers themselves not reachable on your cluster

- What nodes are up and what nodes are down? 

- What about the HDD utilization on the cluster, any machine where the HDD is getting full?
